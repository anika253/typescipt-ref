there are 2 types of languages ..strongly typed and
weekly typed....
strongly typed have less runtime errors
also two types of languages -> compiled and interpreted
--->compiled like c++...->compling and err check and run the compiled
also they are safe languages bcs they eliminate errors
these have both compile time and runtime errors here

---->interpreted laguages have only runtime err
c++ is a stringly typed and js is a loosely typed language
typescript is a superset of javascript maintained by microsoft.
typescipt is never executed..it is converted to js first and then is runned
